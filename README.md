# 5-10x Faster Hyperparameter Tuning with HalvingGridSearch
 
**Hyperparameter tuning** is a method in which you finely tune a machine learning model. Hyperparameters are **not specifically learned** during the training process but can be adjusted to optimize how a model performs. Here are a few tips I like to think about when it comes to hyperparameter tuning:

1. Hyperparameter tuning is generally the **final step** you should perform when building a model, right before the final evaluation.
2. You will **not get dramatically different results** from tuning parameters. The biggest influences on a model's performance are feature selection and model selection. 
3. Hyperparameter tuning can assist with the **generalization of a model**, reducing overfit.
